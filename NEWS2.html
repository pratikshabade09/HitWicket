      <h3>BCCI hails Team India’s unbeaten run to ICC Champions Trophy 2025 glory</h3>

      <p>
        The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) proudly congratulates Team India on their magnificent triumph in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. India showcased their cricketing supremacy, emerging victorious in dominant fashion and reaffirming their place as the top–ranked side in both ODIs and T20Is.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the very outset, the team pursued excellence, overcoming formidable challenges with a brand of cricket that was both fearless and disciplined. Their unbeaten run in an ICC tournament is a true reflection of their consistency, strategic execution, and hunger to succeed on the global stage. The final against New Zealand was the perfect culmination of this journey – an exhibition of resilience and high–pressure mastery.

        The BCCI extends its highest commendation to Captain Rohit Sharma, whose exemplary leadership and tactical acumen were instrumental in guiding the team to this historic achievement. His ability to inspire and lead by example played a defining role in India’s victorious campaign. Notably, this marks India’s second successive ICC title under his leadership in as many years, following the triumphant T20 World Cup 2024 victory. These twin titles firmly establish his legacy as one of India’s finest and most successful captains.
