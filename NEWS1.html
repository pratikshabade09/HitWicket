      <h3>BCCI pays tribute to victims of Pahalgam Terror Attack</h3>

      <p>
        In a solemn gesture of solidarity and respect, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) paid tribute to the victims of the terror attack in Pahalgam during TATA IPL Match No. 41 between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Mumbai Indians at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.

        To honour those who lost their lives, a 60–second moment of silence was observed before the start of play, following a formal announcement over the public address system. This allowed both in–stadium and broadcast audiences to participate in the tribute. During the toss, the captains of both teams offered their condolences and strongly condemned the heinous act. Throughout the match, players, match officials, commentators, and support staff wore black armbands as a mark of respect. The commentary team further acknowledged these gestures on air, reflecting on the emotional significance of the tribute and the nation’s shared grief.

        The BCCI also took a conscious decision to conduct the game without fanfare. There were no cheerleader performances, celebratory fireworks, music, or DJ activities — ensuring a dignified atmosphere that honoured the solemnity of the occasion.

On behalf of the BCCI, while condemning this ghastly and cowardly act with strongest possible words, I extend our heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families and prayers for the departed souls.
